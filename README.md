# PatikaFinalCase

PatikaMarket

I used hashmap for this case

I created admin and user interface

Admin can delete,add and fetch the data

User can purchase and view the data

I use pass and username for security in admin panel (username:patika,password:patika)

I use printf for special format print.

You must use id for delete

You can add new item with enter correct credentials which Ä± defined in panel
